What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository you create a .git file to track any commits in that repository. You need to do it to help track changes over the respository over time.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the midway point between the working directory and commits. The repository is the file on which the staging area works on. This offers value because it allows the user to make changes on the repository that are not permanent.
